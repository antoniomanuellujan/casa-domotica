# Summary

... this is the perfect digital to analog interface for mechanical engineers!

Consists of a "button pusher arm" and a bracket to hold down the servo.

I used two of these to automate my coffee maker: first servo pushes power button, a little Arduino nano checks if cup is present and waits for the coffee maker to heat up, second servo pushes button for one cup and finally first servo pushes power again to turn all off...

Thing includes both arm and clamp for small SG90 as well as stronger MG996R servos. Both types readily available for cheap on eBay.
In the front of the arm you can insert a M3 screw along with a nut (like the acrylic frames of many cheap 3D printers are held together). This allows for easy fine tuning without reprogramming the Arduino ask the time - as I said: mechanical solution approach;-)
To damp the impact of the screw to the button on my coffee maker I glued some small rubber bit to the head of the screw.

The servo horn fits into a matching groove and is held in place by ab drop of super glue. There is a hole in the arm to screw it together, with the horn glued in, to the servo itself.

... I'd appreciate feedback about the buttons you are pushing with this thing!
